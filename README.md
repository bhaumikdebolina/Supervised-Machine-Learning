# Supervised-Machine-Learning

### Predictions
 The Logistic Regression analyzes the dataset as a whole and determines the classes from this which is likely to include some outlier points that may slightly throw off the model.

### Technologies Used 
- Python
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook
- Sci-Kit Learn

### Results and Analysis
Both of the models performed extremely well but the Logistic Regression model was actually slightly better on the test data. The Logistic Regression model had a score of 0.9971798046498831 and the Random Forest Classifier model had a score of 0.9917457697069748. These numbers are both quite strong and I imagine since they are so close they could likely flip using a different random state for the dataset.
